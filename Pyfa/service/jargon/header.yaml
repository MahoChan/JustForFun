# This is a Pyfa jargon file for user definitions.
#
# It is essentially a giant set of find/replace statements in order to translate
# abbreviated Eve community terms into more useful full terms. It is intended
# for translation of strings such as "haml 2" "into "Heavy Assault Missile Launcher II"..
#
# These abbreviations are not case-sensitive. If abbreviations collide, the
# later one is used.
#
# Abbreviations with spaces are not supported.
#
# Syntax:
#
#  abbreviation:
#    - abbreviation
#    - replacement 1
#    - replacement 2
#
# If you do not want abbreviation to expand into itself, just do not add corresponding
# entry. It might make sense for abbreviations like:
#
#  lse:
#    - large shield extender
#
# If you add "lse" as first entry, it will return too many entries you do not want to see,
# like all items which have word "pulse".
#
# The default jargon definitions are stored in pyfa/service/jargon/defaults.yaml. Definitions
# stored in this file have priority. Should you wish to disable any of default definitions,
# simply add entry like:
#
#  abbreviation:
#    - abbreviation
